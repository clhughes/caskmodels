**Notes:**
* This is really just a sample update so you have an idea of what subsections you might want to include in an update. You by no means need to follow this strictly; feel free to add or remove sections as you feel fit. 
* This update is written in markdown, which isn't too hard once you get used to the formatting. I've included two links for reference.
  * [Markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for quick referencing
